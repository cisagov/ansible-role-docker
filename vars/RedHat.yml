# The packages to install
#
# Note that docker-ce is not currently available on any of our supported
# Fedora platforms (32 and 33), so we install the next best thing, which
# is moby-engine.  See https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/moby-engine
# From a usage standpoint, it is transparent, as "docker ..." commands
# are accepted and passed to moby-engine.
package_names:
  - moby-engine

# The pip executable to use
pip_executable: pip3
