# The system packages to install
#
# Note that docker-ce is not currently available on Amazon Linux 2, so
# we install the next best thing, which is moby-engine.
#
# From a usage standpoint, it is transparent, as "docker ..." commands
# are accepted and passed to moby-engine.
package_names:
  - docker-compose
  - moby-engine
  - python3-docker
